I am an experienced Software Engineer passionate about the intersection of **Machine Learning, Computer Graphics, and Physics Simulations**. With over a decade of experience, my work spans from developing large-scale simulation tools for major motion pictures (*Gravity*, *Paddington*, *Guardians of the Galaxy*, *Avatar 2*) to building ML technologies. This includes [real-time face animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQPozzcD6us) at **Ziva/Unity**—presented at [SIGGRAPH 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=wTASo4yaFfBVaHBV&t=2669&v=MAXJWEoKbxY&feature=youtu.be)—and synthetic data generation for bio-authentication at **Meta/Reality Labs**.

My background includes contributing to the simulation technology behind *Avatar 2* (specifically the [Unified multiphysics solver](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3528223.3530058) for water and character interactions) and *Gravity*, where I presented our work on the film's simulation sequences at [SIGGRAPH 2014](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2614106.2614186). My core strength lies in bridging the gap between theory and production; I enjoy leading cross-functional efforts and collaborating closely with diverse teams, including research scientists, software engineers, and technical artists.
