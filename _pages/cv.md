# Work Experience

**July 2024 - Present: Senior Software Engineer - ML / Synthetic Data** (*Meta - Austin, TX*)

* Led the generation of synthetic digital human datasets for AR/VR bio-authentication, coordinating between researchers, technical artists, and makeup artists.
* Spearheaded synthetic data evaluations to identify feature gaps. Proved that synthetic data could fully replace expensive real-world capture datasets, significantly reducing costs on capture & training.
* Integrated and trained GAN-based domain adaptation models to bridge the sim-to-real gap.


**August 2022 - April 2024: Senior Machine Learning Engineer** (*Unity Technologies - Austin, TX*)

* Organized ML engineers and technical artists for [human face driven by markerless monocular video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQPozzcD6us)
* Developed a deep learning model (TCN) to predict tongue and face animation from audio.
* Set up MLOps frameworks using AWS, GitHub Actions, DVC, W&B, and Docker.

**March 2021 - August 2022: Machine Learning Engineer** (*Ziva Dynamics - Wellington, NZ*)

* Improved a 3D digital human data pipeline, reducing processing time (mesh+video) by 3x.
* Developed real-time gaze estimation using CNNs.
* Experimentat with inverse rendering techniques.

**Nov 2015 - Feb 2021: Simulation Software Engineer** (*Weta Digital - Wellington, NZ*)

* Built a simulation pipeline for cloth, hair, and muscles used in *Avatar 2*.
* Empowered artists to develop custom tools and enabled researchers to concentrate on pioneering new algorithms.
* Improved collision and constraint algorithms for digital human simulations. (Contributed to [Unified Multiphysics Solver](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3528223.3530058))
* Integrated physics simulation tools into Houdini and Maya.

**Sep 2010 - Nov 2015: R&D Engineer** (*Framestore - London, UK*)

* Developed pipeline for large-scale rigid body simulations for *Gravity* (presented at [SIGGRAPH 2014](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2614106.2614186)).
* Enhanced parallel solvers for hair simulation used in *Paddington* and *Guardians of the Galaxy*.
